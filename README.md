Time to learn some rust!!

## Installation

To install rust, follow the instructions on the [official rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Running the code

All rust code is in the src/bin directory. To run the code, use the command `cargo run` in the root directory of the project.

Each file in the src directory is a separate rust program. To run a specific program, use the command `cargo run --bin <filename>`.

eg: `cargo run --bin variables`

Each rust program is wrapped inside a `main` function. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

## Order of learning
